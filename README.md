> Meown is a game of games, where your player can join minigames and
> keep all of the same clothing and items you've earned and use it in almost any other minigame.
> The idea was to originally create a MMO platformer building minigame,
> but I instead created a MMO topdown building minigame first.
> The goal is to keep making more minigames similar to the experience of what Club Penguin used to be.
> Parks and worlds are two seperate minigames and the goal is for them to have nearly nothing in common
